# Job Application Tracker

## Disclaimer

This is primarily something I wanted to use to learn more about Go specifically. I'm not sure how far this will end up getting developed without additional assistance or impetous from others. Please feel free to harang me in order to get more work out of me! 

## To-Do

- [ ] More fine-grained searching from the API
- [ ] A better, more informative README
- [ ] Update delete endpoint to use DELETE as a method
- [ ] Automate retrieval of role data from provided URL (so you only need to provide the URL to create a new job app to track)
- [ ] Add a frontend (super easy, right?)
- [ ] Automated builds and tests
- [ ] Configuration for the binary (setting the port at least)
- [ ] Figure out a way to provide data management without an external DB (if you want to run this locally without docker)
